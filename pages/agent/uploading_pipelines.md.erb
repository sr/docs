# Uploading Build Pipelines

The Buildkite Agent’s `pipeline upload` command provides you with a way of storing build pipeline configuration files within your source control, either as static files or dynamically generated from your own scripts.

## Getting started

For example, say you had the following `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` in your project repository:

```yml
steps:
  - name: Example Test
    command: echo "yeah!"
```

To be able to use this pipeline you'd update your project configuration to have the following step:

_TODO: screenshot of upload step configuration_

Running a build first trigger the pipeline upload job:

_TODO: screenshot of a build with the single pipeline upload job_

Which would upload the rest of the pipeline config:

_TODO: screenshot of the build with an updated pipeline_

## Uploading pipelines

Use this command in your build scripts to upload pipelines to Buildkite.

```
Usage:

   buildkite-agent pipeline upload <file> [arguments...]

Description:

   Allows you to change the pipeline of a running build by uploading either a
   JSON or YAML configuration file. If no configuration file is provided,
   we look for the file in the following locations:

   - .buildkite/pipeline.yml
   - .buildkite/pipeline.json

   You can also pipe build pipelines to the command, allowing you to create scripts
   that generate dynamic pipelines.

Example:

   $ buildkite-agent pipeline upload
   $ buildkite-agent pipeline upload my-custom-steps.json
   $ ./script/dynamic_step_generator | buildkite-agent pipeline upload

Options:

   --replace                                    Replace the rest of the existing pipeline with the steps uploaded. Jobs that are already running are not removed. [$BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_REPLACE]
   --job                                        The job that is making the changes to it's build [$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID]
   --agent-access-token                         The access token used to identify the agent [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN]
   --endpoint 'https://agent.buildkite.com/v3'  The Agent API endpoint [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ENDPOINT]
   --no-color                                   Don't show colors in logging [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_NO_COLOR]
   --debug                                      Enable debug mode [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG]
   --debug-http                                 Enable HTTP debug mode, which dumps all request and response bodies to the log [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG_HTTP]
```

## Configuration files

You can use either [YAML](http://yaml.org) or [JSON](http://json.org) to configure your build pipelines. Below is an example of how the YAML configuration would look.

```
# .buildkite/pipeline.yml

env:
  THIS_WILL_APPLY_TO_ALL: true

steps:
  - name: "\:bundler\:"
    command: "bundle install -j8"
    concurrency: 1
    concurrency_group: bundler

  - wait

  - name: "\:rubocop\:"
    command: "script/buildkite/rubocop"

  - name: "\:brakeman\:"
    command: "script/buildkite/brakeman"

  - name: "\:eslint\:"
    command: "script/buildkite/eslint"

  - name: "\:rspec\:"
    command: "script/buildkite/rspec"
    artifact_paths: "tmp/capybara/**/*;coverage/**/*"
    parallelism: 6

  - block

  - name: "\:shipit\:"
    command: "script/buildkite/deploy"
    branches: "master"
    env:
      DEPLOY_KEY: "xxx"
    agents:
      queue: deploy
    concurrency: 1
    concurrency_group: deploy

  - block: "Rollback"

  - command: "script/buildkite/rollback"
    agents:
      queue: deploy
    concurrency: 1
    concurrency_group: rollback
```

### Configuring Concurrency

When throttling the concurrency for a job, we need a way to group the jobs across the pipeline to determine how many of that type are currently running. We do this by creating a "concurrency group identifier" and attach it to all jobs requiring concurrency. Using this method we can query to find out how many of those jobs are running at any one time, and throttle accordingly when a job is scheduled.

When creating steps via the Buildkite UI, we use the jobs’ step UUID as the identifier. However, when creating steps using the `pipeline upload` command, there isn’t a way of creating this identifier, as the step is anonymous and doesn’t have a UUID. In this case, we ask that you provide a unique value to the `concurrency_group` property, which we use as the identifier.

## Migrating existing projects

If you want to migrate a checked in pipeline without interrupting existing branches, you can create a script that can choose to use the old steps defined in your project settings if the build pipeline file is not yet present.

To do this, create a `script/upload-pipeline-to-buildkite.sh` file in your repository, for example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -f ".buildkite/pipeline.yml" ];
then
  echo ".buildkite/pipeline.yml found, will replace current pipeline with steps from it"
  buildkite-agent pipeline upload --replace
else
  echo "No .buildkite/pipeline.yml file, using existing steps"
fi
```

`chmod +x upload-pipeline-to-buildkite.sh` the file, then commit/push to your repository. Now, instead of replacing your entire pipeline with a call to `buildkite-agent pipeline upload`, just prefix the pipeline with a script step that calls the `upload-pipeline-to-buildkite.sh` file we created earlier, then follow this step with a waiter step.

So your pipeline would look something like this:

```
[ upload-pipeline-to-buildkite.sh ] > [ existing pipeline... ]
```

The main difference here is that we only upload the file if it exists, and we upload the pipeline using the `--replace` flag. `--replace` will remove any scheduled steps, and replace them with the steps in the configuration file. Using this method, the branch you first commited the configuration file to will use the new steps, and any existing branch will continue to use the steps defined in the Buildkite UI.
